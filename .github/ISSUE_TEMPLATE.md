## Tips for Submitting Issues
To help us locate problems quickly, we need sufficient information. Please follow our required format when submitting questions. ***If you do not follow the format, we will not be able to respond to your issue***

#### Operation Instructions
Provide detailed descriptions of which interface you're operating on, and every step needs to be detailed. If it's an SDK or API usage issue, you need to specify which function was called and what parameters were used.

#### Observed Behavior
Describe what phenomenon occurred. For example, if a function returns an error, what is the error code? Or what is the status on the interface, such as a red dot indicating message send failure. Don't just say the feature "has a problem" or "doesn't work" in general terms.

#### Expected Result
What do you think the correct behavior should be?

#### Additional Information
Is it reproducible every time or occasionally? Does it only occur on specific networks/devices/platforms, or does it happen on all of them? Also, what version are you using? Is it the latest version?

#### Demo Comparison Results
Please test with the demo and report what the status is in the demo.
